# Meal-Generator-Chatbot
I built a responsive Meal Generator chatbot using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It suggests meal ideas based on user preferences. HTML structured the interface, CSS styled it, and JavaScript handled logic for processing input and displaying recommendations. Great for practicing web development skills!
